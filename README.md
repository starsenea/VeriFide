# VeriFide
Made by Rishikesh and Ethan

## What is VeriFide?
VeriFide is an on-the-go fact checking extension, which takes in information written by a user in Google Docs, and tells us if the sentence is true or false. If false, it returns the correct statement using Google Chrome's Built-in Prompt AI API.

### Future Plans
We are working on converting this to an automatic fact checker, which checks statements as written by the user. 

#### Preparation
You will need to create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?inv=1&invt=AbhxWA&project=verifide)
